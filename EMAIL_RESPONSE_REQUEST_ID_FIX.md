# Email Response Request ID Extraction Fix

## Issue Description

Email responses from riders were not being automatically entered into request notes due to a mismatch between the actual email subject format and the pattern expected by the `extractRequestIdFromSubject` function.

### Root Cause

**Expected Format**: `Assignment <assignmentId> - <requestId>`
**Actual Format**: `Escort Assignment Proposal - <requestId>`

The regex pattern in `extractRequestIdFromSubject` was looking for:
```javascript
/Assignment\s+[^-]+-\s*([^\s]+)/i
```

But the actual email subjects use the format:
```
Escort Assignment Proposal - A-01-24
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Request ID Extraction Function

Updated `extractRequestIdFromSubject` in `Code.gs` to handle the correct subject format:

```javascript
function extractRequestIdFromSubject(subject) {
  try {
    if (!subject) return '';
    
    // Handle the actual subject format: "Escort Assignment Proposal - {requestId}"
    // This pattern allows for flexible whitespace and handles various formats
    const primaryMatch = subject.match(/Escort\s+Assignment\s+Proposal\s*[-–—]\s*([^\s]+)/i);
    if (primaryMatch) {
      return primaryMatch[1].trim();
    }
    
    // Handle simpler format: "Assignment Proposal - {requestId}"
    const simpleMatch = subject.match(/Assignment\s+Proposal\s*[-–—]\s*([^\s]+)/i);
    if (simpleMatch) {
      return simpleMatch[1].trim();
    }
    
    // Fallback to original pattern for backwards compatibility
    const fallbackMatch = subject.match(/Assignment\s+[^-]+-\s*([^\s]+)/i);
    return fallbackMatch ? fallbackMatch[1].trim() : '';
  } catch (error) {
    logError('Error extracting request ID', error);
    return '';
  }
}
```

### 2. Added Testing and Verification Functions

**New Functions Added:**

- `testRequestIdExtraction()` - Tests the extraction function with various subject formats
- `verifyRequestResponseUpdates()` - Verifies that requests contain response information
- `reprocessEmailResponsesWithFixedExtraction()` - Reprocesses existing responses with the fixed extraction

### 3. Enhanced Menu Options

Added new menu items under **🏍️ Escort Management → 📧 Email Response Tracking**:

- 🧪 Test Request ID Extraction
- 🔍 Verify Response Updates  
- 🔄 Reprocess Failed Responses

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Test the Fix
1. Go to **🏍️ Escort Management → 📧 Email Response Tracking → 🧪 Test Request ID Extraction**
2. This will verify that the extraction function works with various subject formats

### Step 2: Reprocess Existing Responses
1. Go to **🏍️ Escort Management → 📧 Email Response Tracking → 🔄 Reprocess Failed Responses**
2. This will check for any responses that failed to extract request IDs and reprocess them

### Step 3: Update Requests with Response Info
1. Go to **🏍️ Escort Management → 📧 Email Response Tracking → 📝 Update Requests with Responses**
2. This will ensure all email responses are properly added to request notes

### Step 4: Verify the Results
1. Go to **🏍️ Escort Management → 📧 Email Response Tracking → 🔍 Verify Response Updates**
2. This will show you how many requests now contain response information

## Expected Results

After applying the fix:

1. **New email responses** will automatically extract request IDs from subjects like "Escort Assignment Proposal - A-01-24"
2. **Request notes** will be automatically updated with rider responses in the format: `"Joe Smith confirmed at 7-25-25 1441 hrs"`
3. **Existing responses** can be reprocessed to catch any that were missed due to the previous issue

## Testing the Fix

Run these commands in the Apps Script editor to verify the fix:

```javascript
// Test the extraction function
testRequestIdExtraction();

// Check current status
verifyRequestResponseUpdates();

// Reprocess any failed responses
reprocessEmailResponsesWithFixedExtraction();
```

## Subject Format Support

The updated function now supports:

- ✅ `Escort Assignment Proposal - A-01-24` (Primary format)
- ✅ `Assignment Proposal - B-02-24` (Simplified format) 
- ✅ `Escort Assignment Proposal — C-03-24` (Em dash)
- ✅ `Assignment 123 - D-04-24` (Legacy format)

## Future Email Processing

Going forward, all new email responses from riders should automatically:

1. Extract the correct request ID from the subject line
2. Log the response in the `Email_Responses` sheet
3. Update the corresponding request's notes with the response information
4. Provide a complete audit trail of rider responses

This ensures that request managers have immediate visibility into rider confirmations and declines directly within each request record.
