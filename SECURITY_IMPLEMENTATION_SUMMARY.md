# Security Implementation Summary
## Comprehensive Authentication & Authorization for Google Apps Script

### üîí What Has Been Implemented

Your Google Apps Script application now has a **multi-layered security system** that provides enterprise-grade protection against unauthorized access while maintaining usability.

---

## ‚úÖ Core Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Hybrid Authentication System**
- **Google OAuth**: Primary authentication method using Google's secure infrastructure
- **Spreadsheet-Based Credentials**: Secondary authentication for users without Google accounts
- **Seamless Integration**: Automatic fallback between authentication methods
- **Enhanced Login UI**: Modern, secure login interface with real-time feedback

### 2. **Advanced Security Controls**
- **Account Lockout Protection**: Automatically locks accounts after 5 failed attempts for 30 minutes
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks (max 10 login attempts per hour)
- **Password Strength Validation**: Enforces strong passwords with 12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, and special characters
- **Session Security**: 8-hour sessions with automatic expiration and secure token management

### 3. **Comprehensive Audit System**
- **Security Event Logging**: All authentication events logged to spreadsheet
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Automatic detection of suspicious activities
- **Email Alerts**: Immediate notifications to administrators for high-severity events
- **Security Reports**: Automated generation of security metrics and recommendations

### 4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Admin Role**: Full system access, user management, security configuration
- **Dispatcher Role**: Operational access to requests, assignments, notifications
- **Rider Role**: Limited access to own assignments and schedule only
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access data appropriate for their role

## üîß Configuration & Customization

### Adjustable Security Settings
```javascript
const SECURITY_CONFIG = {
  // Authentication
  maxFailedAttempts: 5,                    // Account lockout threshold
  lockoutDuration: 30 * 60 * 1000,        // 30 minutes
  sessionTimeout: 8 * 60 * 60 * 1000,     // 8 hours
  
  // Rate Limiting  
  maxLoginAttemptsPerHour: 10,             // Hourly login limit
  maxApiCallsPerMinute: 60,                // API rate limiting
  
  // Password Requirements
  minPasswordLength: 12,                   // Minimum password length
  requireUppercase: true,                  // Require A-Z
  requireLowercase: true,                  // Require a-z
  requireNumbers: true,                    // Require 0-9
  requireSpecialChars: true,               // Require !@#$%^&*
  
  // Monitoring
  logSecurityEvents: true,                 // Enable audit logging
  alertOnSuspiciousActivity: true          // Enable email alerts
};
```

## üìà Best Practices Implemented

### **Authentication Security**
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers prevent single points of failure
2. **Least Privilege**: Users get minimum access needed for their role
3. **Fail Secure**: System defaults to denying access when in doubt
4. **Audit Everything**: All security events are logged and monitored

### **Password Security**
1. **Strong Requirements**: 12+ character minimum with complexity requirements
2. **Hash Storage**: Passwords stored as SHA-256 hashes, never plain text
3. **Breach Prevention**: Common password detection and sequential character blocking
4. **User Guidance**: Real-time password strength feedback

### **Session Security**
1. **Secure Tokens**: UUID-based session identifiers
2. **Time Limits**: Automatic session expiration after 8 hours
3. **Activity Tracking**: Session activity monitoring for anomaly detection
4. **Clean Logout**: Secure session cleanup on user logout

### **Access Control**
1. **Role-Based**: Permissions tied to user roles, not individuals
2. **Data Isolation**: Users can only access appropriate data
3. **Page-Level Control**: Access restrictions at the interface level
4. **API Protection**: Backend function access control
