## 🛠️ Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Replace Current Availability Calendar
1. **Backup** your current `rider-availability.html`
2. **Deploy** the new `enhanced-rider-availability.html`
3. **Add** the PWA files:
   - `availability-calendar-manifest.json`
   - `availability-sw.js`
4. **Update** navigation links to point to the new interface

### Step 2: Add Visual Weekly Planner (Optional)
1. **Deploy** `visual-weekly-planner.html` as an alternative interface
2. **Add menu option** "Visual Planner" in your navigation
3. **Link** it as an alternative scheduling method

### Step 3: Update Your Apps Script Backend
Integrate the enhanced frontend with your existing `AvailabilityService.gs`:

```javascript
// Add these functions to handle new features
function saveGestureAvailability(gestureData) {
  // Handle swipe gesture availability updates
  return saveRiderAvailabilityData({
    date: gestureData.date,
    startTime: gestureData.startTime,
    endTime: gestureData.endTime,
    status: gestureData.status,
    notes: `Set via ${gestureData.method}` // "swipe", "voice", etc.
  });
}

function getAvailabilityPatterns(riderId) {
  // Analyze rider's historical patterns
  // Return suggestions for smart recommendations
  return analyzeRiderPatterns(riderId);
}
```

### Step 4: Enable PWA Features
1. **Add manifest link** to your main HTML files:
```html
<link rel="manifest" href="/availability-calendar-manifest.json">
```

2. **Register service worker** in your JavaScript:
```javascript
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/availability-sw.js');
}
```

3. **Add PWA icons** to your server (see manifest file for required sizes)
