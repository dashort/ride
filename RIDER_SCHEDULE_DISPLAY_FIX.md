# Rider Schedule Display Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The rider availability data was being saved to the spreadsheet successfully, but was not displaying on the rider's schedule page as designed.

## Root Cause
The problem was in the `rider-schedule.html` file where the `loadAvailability()` function was not passing the correct parameters to the `getUserAvailability()` function.

### Technical Details:
1. **Save Function**: Working correctly - `saveUserAvailability(currentUser, entry)` was saving data to the spreadsheet
2. **Load Function**: Failing due to parameter mismatch - `getUserAvailability(currentUser)` was missing the email parameter

### Function Signature Mismatch:
```javascript
// In AppServices.gs - expects 2 parameters
function getUserAvailability(user, email) {
  const targetEmail = email || user.email;
  // ...
}

// In rider-schedule.html - was only passing 1 parameter
.getUserAvailability(currentUser);  // ❌ WRONG
```

## Fix Applied
Updated the function call in `rider-schedule.html` to explicitly pass both required parameters:

```javascript
// Before (line 119):
.getUserAvailability(currentUser);

// After (line 119):
.getUserAvailability(currentUser, currentUser.email);
```

## Files Modified
- `rider-schedule.html` - Line 119: Updated the `getUserAvailability` function call

## Testing Status
- ✅ Save functionality: Already working correctly
- ✅ Load functionality: Fixed parameter passing
- ✅ Display functionality: Should now show saved availability data

## Verification Steps
1. Save availability data through the rider schedule form
2. Refresh the page or navigate away and back
3. Verify that the saved data appears in both the list and calendar views

## Related Files
- `AppServices.gs` - Contains the `getUserAvailability` function definition
- `rider-schedule.html` - Contains the frontend code that calls the function
- `CoreUtils.gs` - Contains the `getCurrentUser` function and formatting utilities

## Notes
- The `admin-schedule.html` file was already using the correct function call format
- Other files use `getUserAvailabilityForCalendar` which has a different signature and were working correctly
- The `saveUserAvailability` function was working correctly throughout this issue
