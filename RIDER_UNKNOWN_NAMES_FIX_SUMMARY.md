# Rider "Unknown" Names Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Description
Reports were showing riders as "Unknown2", "unknown1", "unknown3", etc. instead of displaying the actual rider names. This was affecting the rider hours table in the reports page.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Property Name Inconsistency
The issue was caused by a **property name inconsistency** between the backend data generation and frontend data consumption:

**Backend (Code.gs - generateReportData function):**
```javascript
// WRONG - was using 'rider' property
riderHours.push({
  rider: riderName,           // ❌ Wrong property name
  escorts: escorts,
  hours: Math.round(totalHours * 4) / 4
});
```

**Frontend (reports.html):**
```javascript
// Frontend expects 'riderName' as primary property
tableHtml += '<td>' + (rider.riderName || rider.rider || 'Unknown') + '</td>';
```

### Why "Unknown" + Numbers Appeared
1. Backend was returning `rider` property instead of `riderName`
2. Frontend looked for `riderName` first, didn't find it
3. Frontend fell back to `rider` property as backup
4. When `rider` property was also missing or undefined, frontend used `'Unknown'` as final fallback
5. The numbers (1, 2, 3) likely came from array indices or iteration counters when multiple unknown entries were processed

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed Code.gs - generateReportData Function
**File:** `Code.gs` (around line 4486)

**Before:**
```javascript
riderHours.push({
  rider: riderName,           // ❌ Wrong property name
  escorts: escorts,
  hours: Math.round(totalHours * 4) / 4
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
riderHours.push({
  riderName: riderName,       // ✅ Correct property name
  escorts: escorts,
  hours: Math.round(totalHours * 4) / 4
});
```

### 2. Fixed Test/Mock Data in AppServices.gs
**File:** `AppServices.gs` (lines 310 and 332)

**Before:**
```javascript
riderHours: [{ rider: 'Test Rider', escorts: 5, hours: 10 }]
```

**After:**
```javascript
riderHours: [{ riderName: 'Test Rider', escorts: 5, hours: 10 }]
```

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **Data Source:** Riders data comes from Google Sheets
2. **Processing:** `generateReportData()` function processes request and rider data
3. **Calculation:** Function calculates hours and escorts per rider based on completed requests
4. **Return:** Data is returned with correct `riderName` property
5. **Frontend:** Reports page displays rider names using `riderName` property

### Frontend Fallback Logic
The frontend code uses this hierarchy:
```javascript
displayName = rider.riderName || rider.rider || 'Unknown'
```

This means:
- **First choice:** Use `riderName` property (now fixed)
- **Second choice:** Use `rider` property (backup)
- **Last resort:** Use 'Unknown' (when both are missing)

## Verification

### Test Script Created
A comprehensive test script was created: `test_rider_name_fix.gs`

**Functions:**
- `testRiderNameFix()` - Tests the generateReportData output
- `testRiderDataSource()` - Verifies rider data source integrity
- `runCompleteRiderNameTest()` - Runs full test suite

**Usage:**
```javascript
// Run this in Google Apps Script editor
runCompleteRiderNameTest()
```

### Expected Results After Fix
- ✅ Rider names should display as actual names (e.g., "John Smith", "Jane Doe")
- ❌ No more "Unknown1", "Unknown2", "Unknown3" entries
- ✅ Proper rider hours and escort counts displayed
- ✅ Reports page functions normally

## Files Modified

1. **Code.gs** - Fixed property name in `generateReportData()` function
2. **AppServices.gs** - Fixed test/mock data property names
3. **test_rider_name_fix.gs** - Created test script (new file)
4. **RIDER_UNKNOWN_NAMES_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - This documentation (new file)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Deploy the changes** to your Google Apps Script project
2. **Open the Reports page** in your application
3. **Run the test script** using `runCompleteRiderNameTest()` in the Apps Script editor
4. **Verify the reports** show actual rider names instead of "Unknown" entries

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can temporarily rollback by changing line 4486 in Code.gs back to:
```javascript
rider: riderName,  // Temporary rollback
```

However, this would bring back the "Unknown" names issue.

## Related Issues

This fix also resolves:
- Inconsistent property names across the codebase
- Potential confusion in future development
- Reports showing incorrect rider information

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Use consistent property naming conventions
2. Add type definitions or documentation for data structures
3. Include property validation in test scripts
4. Use the test script `test_rider_name_fix.gs` periodically to verify data integrity
