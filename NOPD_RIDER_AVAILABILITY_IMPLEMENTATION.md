# NOPD Rider Availability Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds support for NOPD (New Orleans Police Department) riders and modifies the system to ignore availability status when selecting NOPD riders for requests. NOPD represents another organization with a large number of riders who are always considered available.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Organization Field to Rider Data Structure

**File: `Config.gs`**
- Added `organization: 'Organization'` to the `CONFIG.columns.riders` configuration
- This creates the new Organization column in the riders sheet

**File: `riders.html`**
- Added Organization field to the rider form with options:
  - "Internal (Default)" - for regular riders
  - "NOPD" - for New Orleans Police Department riders  
  - "Other Organization" - for future expansion
- Added Organization column to the riders table display
- Updated `saveRider()` function to include organization data
- Updated `editRider()` function to populate organization field

**File: `RiderCRUD.gs`**
- Modified `mapRowToRiderObject()` function to include organization field mapping
- Ensures organization data is properly handled when creating/updating riders

### 2. Modified Availability Checking Logic

**File: `AppServices.gs`**
- Updated `isRiderAvailable()` function to skip availability checks for NOPD riders
- NOPD riders are always considered available regardless of their calendar availability
- Added logging to track when availability checks are skipped for NOPD riders

### 3. Enhanced UI to Show NOPD Rider Status

**File: `requests.html`**
- Modified rider assignment cards to show special styling for NOPD riders
- Added green "ðŸš“ NOPD - Always Available" indicator for NOPD riders
- Added CSS styles for NOPD rider visual indicators:
  - Green status indicator with glow effect
  - Green left border and subtle background gradient
- NOPD riders are not marked as unavailable even if availability data suggests otherwise

**File: `assignments.html`**
- Applied same NOPD visual treatment in assignment interface
- Added corresponding CSS styles for NOPD rider cards
- Updated rider card generation logic to handle NOPD organization

## Functionality

### For NOPD Riders:
1. **Always Available**: Availability calendar status is ignored
2. **Visual Indication**: Special green styling and "NOPD - Always Available" label
3. **No Conflicts**: Never shown as unavailable in rider selection interfaces
4. **Organization Tracking**: Clearly identified as NOPD organization in rider records

### For Regular Riders:
1. **Normal Availability Checking**: Existing availability logic remains unchanged
2. **Standard Visual Treatment**: Normal availability indicators and styling
3. **Organization Field**: Can be set to "Internal" or "Other Organization"

## Usage

### Adding NOPD Riders:
1. Go to Riders management page
2. Click "Add New Rider"
3. Fill in rider details
4. Set Organization to "NOPD"
5. Save the rider

### Converting Existing Riders to NOPD:
1. Edit the rider record
2. Change Organization field to "NOPD"
3. Save changes

### Assigning NOPD Riders:
1. NOPD riders will show with green "ðŸš“ NOPD - Always Available" indicator
2. They can be selected regardless of calendar availability
3. No availability conflicts will be shown for NOPD riders

## Technical Notes

- The organization field is backward compatible - existing riders without organization data will default to "Internal"
- The availability bypass only applies to riders specifically marked as "NOPD" organization
- Availability data is still stored for NOPD riders but is ignored during selection
- The implementation maintains all existing functionality for non-NOPD riders

## Future Enhancements

- Could add more organization types with different availability rules
- Could add organization-specific rider assignment preferences
- Could implement organization-based reporting and analytics
- Reports list the consolidated NOPD entry last to keep focus on other riders
