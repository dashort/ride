# Assignment Loading Quick Fix Guide

## Problem
No assignments are being shown even after creating sample assignments in the notifications page or elsewhere in the system.

## Quick Solution

### Option 1: Use the Fix Button (Recommended)
1. Go to the **Notifications** page in your application
2. Look for the **ðŸ”§ Fix Assignment Loading** button in the action bar
3. Click the button and wait for the fix to complete
4. The page will automatically reload if successful

### Option 2: Use the Script Editor
If you have access to Google Apps Script:

1. Open the Google Apps Script project
2. Run this function in the script editor:
   ```javascript
   runAssignmentLoadingFix()
   ```
3. Check the execution logs for detailed results

### Option 3: Create Sample Data Only
If you just need test assignments:

1. Go to the **Notifications** page
2. Click **âž• Create Sample Assignments** button
3. This will create 3 sample assignments with different riders and statuses

## What the Fix Does

The comprehensive fix performs these steps:

1. **Diagnosis**: Checks if the assignments sheet exists and has valid data
2. **Sheet Creation**: Creates the assignments sheet if missing
3. **Sample Data**: Adds sample assignments if no valid data exists
4. **Cache Clearing**: Clears cached data to force fresh loading
5. **Verification**: Tests that assignments load correctly

## Expected Results

After running the fix, you should see:
- âœ… Assignment count in stats showing > 0
- âœ… Assignment cards displayed in the "All Assignments" section
- âœ… No more "No assignments found" messages

## Sample Assignments Created

The fix creates these sample assignments:
- **ASG-001**: Tomorrow's assignment (John Smith) - Needs notification
- **ASG-002**: Day after tomorrow (Sarah Wilson) - Already notified  
- **ASG-003**: Today's assignment (Mike Johnson) - Needs notification

## Troubleshooting

### If assignments still don't show:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify you have proper permissions to access the Google Sheet
3. Try refreshing the browser page
4. Run the diagnostic function: `testAssignmentLoading()`

### If you get permission errors:
1. Make sure you're logged in with the correct Google account
2. Check that the Google Apps Script has necessary permissions
3. Try re-authorizing the script

### For developers:
Check these functions in the script editor:
- `getAssignmentsData()` - Should return sheet data
- `getAllAssignmentsForNotifications()` - Should return filtered assignments
- `createSampleAssignmentsForTesting()` - Should create test data
