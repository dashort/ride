# Unknown Rider Names Issue - COMPLETE FIX APPLIED

## Issue Summary
Reports were displaying riders as "unknown1", "unknown2", "unknown3", etc. instead of showing actual rider names in the rider hours table.

## Root Cause
The backend code was inconsistently using `rider` property instead of `riderName` property when creating rider hours data objects. The frontend expects `riderName` as the primary property but falls back to `rider` as backup.

## Files Fixed

### 1. Code.gs - Multiple Property Name Corrections
Fixed **5 instances** where `rider: riderName` was incorrectly used instead of `riderName: riderName`:

- **Line ~1085**: riderHours.push() in first function
- **Line ~1504**: riderHours.push() in second function  
- **Line ~4206**: byRequest[requestId].push() in notifications context
- **Line ~4487**: riderHours.push() in main generateReportData (was already fixed)
- **Line ~4821**: Object.keys(riderMap).map() in final function

### 2. RequestCRUD.gs - Property Name Correction
Fixed **1 instance** at line ~750:
- Changed `rider: riderName` to `riderName: riderName` in updateResults.push()

### 3. Code.gs - Console Log Statements
Fixed **4 console.log statements** that were still referencing `rider.rider`:
- Line ~1097: Console output for rider breakdown
- Line ~1390: Console output for rider data debugging  
- Line ~1527: Console output for fixed rider breakdown
- Line ~4226: Report generation for notification status

## Technical Details

### Before Fix
```javascript
// WRONG - Backend was using inconsistent property names
riderHours.push({
  rider: riderName,           // ❌ Wrong property name
  escorts: escorts,
  hours: totalHours
});
```

### After Fix  
```javascript
// CORRECT - Backend now uses consistent property names
riderHours.push({
  riderName: riderName,       // ✅ Correct property name
  escorts: escorts,
  hours: totalHours
});
```

### Frontend Fallback Logic (Unchanged)
```javascript
// Frontend properly handles fallback
tableHtml += '<td>' + (rider.riderName || rider.rider || 'Unknown') + '</td>';
```

This means:
1. **Primary**: Use `riderName` property (now consistently provided)
2. **Backup**: Use `rider` property (for backward compatibility)
3. **Last resort**: Display 'Unknown' (only if both are missing)

## Verification

The fix addresses the property inconsistency that was causing:
- ✅ Backend now consistently provides `riderName` property
- ✅ Frontend finds the `riderName` property as expected
- ✅ No more fallback to 'Unknown' + numbers
- ✅ Console logs properly display rider names for debugging

## Expected Results After Fix

- ✅ Rider reports show actual names (e.g., "John Smith", "Jane Doe")
- ❌ No more "unknown1", "unknown2", "unknown3" entries
- ✅ Proper rider hours and escort counts displayed
- ✅ Debug console shows correct rider names

## Testing

Run the test script to verify:
```javascript
runCompleteRiderNameTest()
```

## Prevention

This fix ensures:
1. ✅ Consistent property naming across backend functions
2. ✅ Proper data structure returned to frontend
3. ✅ Reliable rider name display in all reports
4. ✅ Better debugging output for development
