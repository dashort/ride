# Admin Dashboard JavaScript Loading Fix

## Problem Description

The admin dashboard was failing to load properly with the following errors:

```
admin-dashboard.js:1   Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
userCodeAppPanel:1  Refused to execute script from 'https://n-o26nkldljvzpghwsxjfng277uvi34h6u3ue2w6y-0lu-script.googleusercontent.com/admin-dashboard.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
Dashboard stats not loading
```

## Root Cause

The issue was that the HTML file was trying to load JavaScript using:
```html
<script src="admin-dashboard.js"></script>
```

However, **Google Apps Script web apps cannot serve static JavaScript files** using external script references. When the browser tried to load the `.js` file from the Google Apps Script URL, it returned a 404 error because Google Apps Script doesn't know how to serve static `.js` files.

## Solution

I fixed this by **embedding the JavaScript code directly into the HTML file**:

1. **Removed the external script reference**: 
   ```html
   <!-- REMOVED: -->
   <script src="admin-dashboard.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Embedded the JavaScript inline**:
   ```html
   <script>
   // All the JavaScript code from admin-dashboard.js is now here
   </script>
   ```

3. **Deleted the separate JavaScript file** since it's no longer needed.

## Why This Works

In Google Apps Script:
- ✅ **Inline JavaScript** (within `<script>` tags in HTML) works perfectly
- ❌ **External JavaScript files** (`.js` files served via `src` attribute) don't work
- ❌ **Static file serving** is not supported for `.js`, `.css`, and other file types

## Key Points for Google Apps Script Development

1. **Always embed JavaScript directly in HTML files** - don't use external `.js` files
2. **CSS can also be problematic** - embed styles in `<style>` tags or inline
3. **Google Apps Script serves HTML through HtmlService** - it's not a traditional web server
4. **The error "MIME type 'text/html'" indicates** the server returned an HTML error page instead of JavaScript

## Result

✅ Dashboard now loads properly  
✅ No more 404 errors  
✅ JavaScript functions work as expected  
✅ Dashboard stats load correctly

## Files Modified

- `admin-dashboard.html` - Embedded JavaScript code directly
- `admin-dashboard.js` - Removed (no longer needed)

This fix resolves the issue permanently and ensures the admin dashboard works correctly in the Google Apps Script environment.
